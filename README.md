# TinyBoard84100

Tiny beakout board for the ATtiny841 (or any other 14 pin
AVR) with AVR ISP programming header, voltage regulated and
with reset button.

It is programmable with the Arduino IDE with the ATtiny
library addon thingy. Or a proper toolchain for all the
tryhard nerds out there :)

Designed in KiCAD open-source and possibly for sale on Tindie
somewhere in the future. No promisses.

It's actually a second version of the design, first was not
published nor tested. It was designed, manufactured and forgoten about.

If you're experienced and want to tell me how wrong I did
everything, feel free to PM me. I'm open to your feedback.
